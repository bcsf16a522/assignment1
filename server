ServerL:      It passively waits for response to cliens and it is passive socket.

Socket creation:
	int sockfd= soket(domain,type,protocol)

bind:
	int bind(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr,socklen_t addrlen);
it is basically use after when u create the socket,it binds the socket with address and port number.

listen:
	int listen(int sockfd, int backlog);

it puts the server socket in passive mode where it waits for client to approch the server to make a connection.

accepts:
	int new_socket= accept(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t *addrlen);

					client....

Client:   It initiates the communication and it must know the port and address of server.it is active socket.

socket connection:
	int sockfd = socket(domain, type, protocol)
it is same as that of server.

Connect:

int connect(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr,  
                             socklen_t addrlen);

The connect() system call connects the socket referred to by the file descriptor sockfd to the address specified by addr. Serverâ€™s address and port is specified in addr.
